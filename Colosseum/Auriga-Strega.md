## TACTICS
At the beginning of combat, the Mother activates her Prehensile Hair hex as a standard action and also spends a swift action in order to identify the strongest opponent (and set up for Kirin Style). In following rounds she will Evil-Eye whichever target looks the most threatening, following up with a cackle to keep the debuff active as well as applying a Accursed Hex/Spellstrike with Bestow Curse or Blindness Deafness. If it seems as though she will be unable to hit the target, she begins using castings of other debuff spells like Ill Omen.

## SPECIAL ABILITIES

### Arcane pool (SU)
At 1st level, the magus gains a reservoir of mystical arcane energy that he can draw upon to fuel his powers and enhance his weapon. 
This arcane pool has a number of points equal to 1/2 his magus level (minimum 1) + his Intelligence modifier. 
The pool refreshes once per day when the magus prepares his spells.

At 1st level, a magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a swift action to grant any weapon he is holding a +1 enhancement bonus for 1 minute.
For every four levels beyond 1st, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +5 at 17th level.
These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon enhancement to a maximum of +5.
Multiple uses of this ability do not stack with themselves.

At 5th level, these bonuses can be used to add any of the following weapon properties:
dancing, flaming, flaming burst, frost, icy burst, keen, shock, shocking burst, speed, or vorpal.
Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property’s base price modifier.
These properties are added to any the weapon already has, but duplicates do not stack.
If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added.
These bonuses and properties are decided when the arcane pool point is spent and cannot be changed until the next time the magus uses this ability.
These bonuses do not function if the weapon is wielded by anyone other than the magus.
A magus can only enhance one weapon in this way at one time. If he uses this ability again, the first use immediately ends.

### Spell Combat (EX)
At 1st level, a magus learns to cast spells and wield his weapons at the same time. This functions much like two-weapon fighting, but the off-hand weapon is a spell that is being cast.
To use this ability, the magus must have one hand free (even if the spell being cast does not have somatic components), while wielding a light or one-handed melee weapon in the other hand.
As a full-round action, he can make all of his attacks with his melee weapon at a –2 penalty and can also cast any spell from the magus spell list with a casting time of 1 standard action (any attack roll made as part of this spell also takes this penalty).
If he casts this spell defensively, he can decide to take an additional penalty on his attack rolls, up to his Intelligence bonus, and add the same amount as a circumstance bonus on his concentration check.
If the check fails, the spell is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty.
A magus can choose to cast the spell first or make the weapon attacks first, but if he has more than one attack, he cannot cast the spell between weapon attacks.

### Spellstrike (EX)
At 2nd level, whenever a magus casts a spell with a range of “touch” from the magus spell list, he can deliver the spell through any weapon he is wielding as part of a melee attack.
Instead of the free melee touch attack normally allowed to deliver the spell, a magus can make one free melee attack with his weapon (at his highest base attack bonus) as part of casting this spell.
If successful, this melee attack deals its normal damage as well as the effects of the spell. If the magus makes this attack in concert with spell combat, this melee attack takes all the penalties accrued by spell combat melee attacks.
This attack uses the weapon’s critical range (20, 19–20, or 18–20 and modified by the keen weapon property or similar effects), but the spell effect only deals ×2 damage on a successful critical hit, while the weapon damage uses its own critical modifier.

### Magus arcana
  * Arcane Accuracy
  * Hex Arcana - Evil Eye
  * Hex Arcana - Accursed Strike
  * Hex Arcana - Cackle

### Spell recall
At 4th level, the magus learns to use his arcane pool to recall spells he has already cast. With a swift action he can recall any single magus spell that he has already prepared and cast that day by expending a number of points from his arcane pool equal to the spell’s level (minimum 1). The spell is prepared again, just as if it had not been cast.

### Hex Magus (SU)
At 4th level, the hexcrafter magus gains access to a small number of witch’s hexes.
The hexcrafter magus picks one hex from the witch’s hex class feature. He gains the benefit of or uses that hex as if he were a witch of a level equal to his magus level.
This feature replaces spell recall.

### Hex Arcana
A hexcrafter gains access to the following magus arcana, or may select any witch hex in place of a magus arcana.
At 12th level, the hexcrafter may select a hex or major hex in place of a magus arcana.
At 18th level, a hexcrafter can select a hex, major hex, or grand hex in place of a magus arcana.
He cannot select any hex or arcana more than once.

Accursed Strike (Sp): A hexcrafter magus who can cast bestow curse, major curse, or any spell with the curse descriptor can deliver these prepared spells using the spellstrike ability, even if the spells are not touch attack spells.

### Knowledge pool
At 7th level, when a magus prepares his magus spells, he can decide to expend 1 or more points from his arcane pool, up to his Intelligence bonus. For each point he expends, he can treat any one spell from the magus spell list as if it were in his spellbook and can prepare that spell as normal that day. If he does not cast spells prepared in this way before the next time he prepares spells, he loses those spells. He can also cast spells added in this way using his spell recall ability, but only until he prepares spells again.

### Improved spell combat
At 8th level, the magus’s ability to cast spells and make melee attacks improves. When using the spell combat ability, the magus receives a +2 circumstance bonus on concentration checks, in addition to any bonus granted by taking an additional penalty on the attack roll.
